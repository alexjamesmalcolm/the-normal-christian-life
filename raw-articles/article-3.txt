Now  resurrection  is  quite  different. I  enter  
into His  death, but I do not enter into His  
Resurrection.  Praise the  Lord  !  His resurrection 
enters  into  me,  and so  I  get  new  life. The death 
of  the  Lord  is 5 <
  I  in  Christ  " ;  the resurrection  
is " Christ  in me  ".  How  is it  possible  for  Christ  
to communicate His  resurrection-life to me ? 
How  do  I  receiA*e this  new  life  ? I n  A*erse  fiVe  
Paul answers  our  question Avith  a  very  good  
illustration. The  Avord  " united  " in  the  Greek  
is grafted and we haA-e  a ver}*  beautiful  
picture here of the life of Christ which is imparted 
to us  through  His  resurrection. I n  Fukien I 
once  visited  a  man  Avho owned  an  orchard. He 
had  three  or four  acres of  land, and  about  three  
hundred  fruit  trees. I  enquired  if  his  trees  had  
been  grafted, or  if  they were  just  the  original  
stuck. " Do  you think  *',  he  replied,  ';
 that I 
Avould waste my land growing ungrafted trees  ?  "  
I  asked  him  to  explain  the  process  of  grafting,  
which  he  gladly  did. " When  a  tree  has  grown  
to  a  certain  height  I  lop  off  the  top  and  then  
graft  it he said. Pointing  to  a special tree,  he  
asked, " Do  you see  that tree  ? I call  it  the  
father tree, because all the other trees are grafted 
from  that  one. I f the  other  trees  Avere just  left  
to  follow  the  course  of  nature,  their fruit would 
be  about  the  size  of  a  raspbeny,  and  it  would  
consist  mostly  of  thick  skin  and  seeds. This 
tree from which they are grafted  bears a luscious 
fruit,  the  size  of a plum, Avith very thin skin and 
tiny seeds ".  " How does it happen  ? ", I asked. 
"  I  simply  take  a  little  of  the  nature  of the  one  
tree  and transfer it to  the  other he explained. 
" I  make  a  cleaAr
age  in  the  poor  tree  and insert 
a  slip  from  the  good  one,  then  bind  it  up  and  
leave  it  to  grow  ". " But  how  can  it  grow  ?  : ; 
I asked. " I  don't knoAv he  said,  " But  it  
does grow  ". Then  he showed  me  a tree bearing 
miserably  poor  fruit  below  the  graft  and  rich  
juicy  fruit  above. How  can  one  tree  bear  the  
fruit  of another  ?  How  can an old tree bear new 
fruit  ? How  can  a  poor  tree  bear  good  fruit ? 
By  grafting. Then  if  a  man  can  graft  a branch 
of  one  tree  into  another,  cannot  God graft  the  
life  of  His  Son  into  us ? 
A  Chinese Avoman burned  her  arm badly and 
was  taken  to  hospital. I t  was  found  necessary  
to  graft  some  neAv skin  OA*er the  injured  area,  
but the doctor attempted in  vain  to graft a 
piece  of her own skin on  to  the  arm ;  it  was  too  

poor. A  foreign  nurse  offered a  piece  of  skin,  
and the operation Avas  thoroughly successful. 
The  new  skin  knit  to  the  old,  and  the  woman  
left hospital with her arm perfectly healed ; 
but  there  remained a  patch  of  white  skin on her 
yellow  arm to  tell the  tale  of  the  past. You ask 
hoAv the  skin  of  another- grew  on  that  woman's  
arm  ?  I  do  not  know  how  it  grew,  but  I  know  
that it  did  grow. I f  an  earthly  surgeon  can  
graft  a piece  of skin from  one  human body  on  to  
another, cannot  the Divine  Surgeon  graft the 

life  of  His  Son  into  me  ? I  do  not  knoAv how 
it  is  done,  but  it  is  done. We  can  do  nothing,  
and  we  need  do  nothing,  for  God  has  already  
done  everything. 
God  has  done  everything. There  is  only  one  
fruitful life in the Avorld and that has been 
grafted into millions  of other lives. We call 
this  the  new  birth. New  birth  is  the  rece2>tion  
of a  life  which I did  not  possess  before. It is not  Austins-Sparks.Net - AWAT Volume 19 - Searchable
that my life has been changed at a l l ; it is 
another life,  a life  altogether  new and  altogether  
Divine,  which has  become my  life. God has  cut  
off the  old  creation  by the  Cross of His Son, and 
my  baptism  is  my  recognition  of that  fact.  
The  Reckoning  of Faith  
The  normal  Christian  life,  initially  and  pro-
gressively, is  by faith  in  the Cross  of Christ. 
But  what  is  faith  ? Faith  is  my  acceptance  of  
God's  fact. Faith  always  relates  to  the  past ; 
anything  that  relates  to  the  future  is  not  faith,  
it  is  hope.  
Mark xi. 24 explains the  nature of faith. 4 4
 All 
things  whatsoever  ye  pray  and  ask  for,  believe  
that  ye  Jiave  received  them,  and  ye  shall  have  
them I f  you  believe  you  already  " have  re-
ceived  "  your  requests,  then  you " shall  have  
them  ".  To believe  that you  may get  something,  
or  that  you  can  get  it,  or  even  that  you  shall  
get  it, is not  faith. This is faithâ€”to  believe  that  
you  have already got  it. Only that  which relates 
to  the  past  is  true  faith. Those  who  say, 4 4
 God 
can  ",  or 4 4
  God  may  ",  or 4 4
  God  must", or 4 4
  God shall ",  do  not  necessarily  believe  at all. 
Faith  always  says, 4 4
  God  has  done  it 
Then  when have  I  faith  in regard to  my  cruci-
fixion  ?  Not  when  I  say  God can crucify  me, or 
will  crucify  me,  but  when  with  joy  I  say, praise 
God,  in  Christ  1  am  crucified.  Temptation may 
come and Satan may try to  prove I am not dead, 
but  once  I  see  that  I  am  crucified with  Christ  I  
can laugh in the face  of temptation. The trouble 
with  many  is  that  as  soon  as  temptation  comes  
they begin to ask; 4 4
  Have  I really  died  ?  "  
The}* believe  Satan's  lies  and  deny  God's truth. 
God has said that when Christ died I  died, and I 
bank  everything  on  His word. I t is  done,  there-
fore  there  is nothing  for  me to  do,  but merely to 
see  this  as  an eternal fact.
