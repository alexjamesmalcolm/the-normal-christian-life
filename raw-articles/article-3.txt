The  Reckoning  of Faith  
The  normal  Christian  life,  initially  and  pro-
gressively, is  by faith  in  the Cross  of Christ. 
But  what  is  faith  ? Faith  is  my  acceptance  of  
God's  fact. Faith  always  relates  to  the  past ; 
anything  that  relates  to  the  future  is  not  faith,  
it  is  hope.  
Mark xi. 24 explains the  nature of faith. 4 4
 All 
things  whatsoever  ye  pray  and  ask  for,  believe  
that  ye  Jiave  received  them,  and  ye  shall  have  
them I f  you  believe  you  already  " have  re-
ceived  "  your  requests,  then  you " shall  have  
them  ".  To believe  that you  may get  something,  
or  that  you  can  get  it,  or  even  that  you  shall  
get  it, is not  faith. This is faithâ€”to  believe  that  
you  have already got  it. Only that  which relates 
to  the  past  is  true  faith. Those  who  say, 4 4
 God 
can  ",  or 4 4
  God  may  ",  or 4 4
  God  must", or 4 4
  God shall ",  do  not  necessarily  believe  at all. 
Faith  always  says, 4 4
  God  has  done  it 
Then  when have  I  faith  in regard to  my  cruci-
fixion  ?  Not  when  I  say  God can crucify  me, or 
will  crucify  me,  but  when  with  joy  I  say, praise 
God,  in  Christ  1  am  crucified.  Temptation may 
come and Satan may try to  prove I am not dead, 
but  once  I  see  that  I  am  crucified with  Christ  I  
can laugh in the face  of temptation. The trouble 
with  many  is  that  as  soon  as  temptation  comes  
they begin to ask; 4 4
  Have  I really  died  ?  "  
The}* believe  Satan's  lies  and  deny  God's truth. 
God has said that when Christ died I  died, and I 
bank  everything  on  His word. I t is  done,  there-
fore  there  is nothing  for  me to  do,  but merely to 
see  this  as  an eternal fact.
