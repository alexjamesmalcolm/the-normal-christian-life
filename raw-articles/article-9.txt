B u t after  we  have entered i n t o t h i s l i f e we  shall

mean  to  walk  ?  Just  to  t a k e  one  step  a f t e r  another.  
W a l k i n g suggests  s o m e t h i n g progressive. Paul says. 
"  W h o walk  not  after  the  flesh,  but a f t e r  the  S p i r i t  
(Rom. v i i i . 4 ) . 
W h a t the Flesh I s 
What is  the  flesh  ? W c m u s t u n d e r s t a n d t h a t , i f  
we  are  to  know  a  w a l k  i n  the  S p i r i t . T h e  word  in  the  
original means the fleshly p a r t o f our body. But 
what is flesh after all '. T h e L o r d J e s u s gives a n 
e x a m p l e in J u h n i i i . G, " T h a t w h i e h is born of the 
flesh is  flesh  " . I f  we  w o u l d  k n o w  w h a t is  o f the flesh, 
we only need ask w h e t h e r or nut i t is horn of the 
flesh. K e r r y  thing  that conies  f u u n the Mesh,  h o w e v e r  
good,  is  flesh. T h e q u e s t i o n is  not w h e t h e r a  thine is 
UOod  or bad : tin- q u e s t i o n is  wheliee it eonies T h e 
whole  question <>! flesh is  d e r i d e d liy origin. 
W e  k n o w  w e  have  a l l  been  born  o f  the  flesh  :  there-

w i t h m a n y Christians is  t h i s ,  t h a t t h e y  have  never I 
passed j u d g m e n t on  the flesh. T h e y  t h i n k  the flesh 

can be  u t i l i z e d  i n  t h e service  o f G c d . I f  a man is- [

t h a t  is  b o r n  of  the  flesh  is  flesh  and must go  to  the  
Cross. 
M a n y a  one  who  f o r m e r l y  used  his  b r a i n  power  to  
s t u d y geography, h i s t o r y  or m a t h e m a t i c s now  uses  
t h a t  same  power  t o  s t u d y  t h e  W o r d of  God. A man 
w h o  i n  d a y s  past  used  his  a n a l y t i c a l  powers  t o  study i 

science,  n o w  uses  t h e m  t o  s t u d y  t h e o l o g y . There  is  a  
change o f  subject,  but  no  change o f power  ;  there  is a 
change  o f  i n t e r e s t ,  b u t  no  change  o f  energy. I t was  
n a t u r a l  energy before,  and i t  is  n a t u r a l  energy s t i l l . 
There  is  no  difference  i n the  energy employed  ; the 
o n l y difference is i n t h e channel i n t o which i t is 
directed. F o r m e r l y  i t  was  directed  t o  secular  things  :  
now i t  is  directed  to s p i r i t u a l  t h i n g s . I t is  s t i l l the  
same  man who  is  doing  the  w o r k ,  and it is s t i l l the 
same  powers  t h a t  arc  being used. 
W h a t Powers are Y o u E m p l o y i n g  ?  
T h e question G o d is  asking  of  us  is  not.  w h a t are  
y o u d o i n g ,  but what power  arc  y o u  e m p l o y i n g  to  do  
it i W e t h i n k  little  of  the  source  o f  our  energy,  and  
m u c h of  t h e end  to  w h i c h  it is  d i r e c t e d . W e reason

can be brought i n t o C h r i s t . W c need n o t o n l y a 
change  of  object, b u t a change  o f power t o a t t a i n 
t h a t object. Our L o r d said, " 1 can of  myself do 
n o t h i n g  " (John v . 19). K v c n t h e Son of  God was 
the  source  of  n o t h i n g  : the  F a t h e r  was  the. source  o f  
a l l  things. N o w  j u s t  here  comes  t h e  question  o f  w a l k .  
A  t r u e  Christian  walk  involves  a  c o n t i n u a l renouncing  
o f  self,  and an u t t e r  dependence upon God. Our 
a t t i t u d e  at  all  times  must be.  L o r d ,  I  can  do n o t h i n g  
o f  m y s e l f ;  I t r u s t  Thee by  T h y S p i r i t  to  b r i n g me 
t h r o u g h . 
Let  n.« i l l u s t r a t e .  M r .  A .  is a  v e r y  good  speaker. H e 
can  t a l k  fluently  and  most  c o n v i n c i n g l y on any  subject. 
but  he is a very  bad  manager.  M r .  B .  is a  poor  speaker;  
he  cannot  express  h i m s e l f  a t  a l l ,  but  goes  round and 
round  his  subject,  never  coming  t o  the  p o i n t . B u t  he  
is  a  splendid  manager,  most  competent i n  all  business  
m a t t e r s . B o t h  get  converted  and  b o t h  become  earnest 
Christians.  I  call on  M r . A . and  i n v i t e h i m  to speak  at  a  
conference. T h e r e a f t e r I  call on  M r .  B .  w i t h  the  same  
request. N o w  what w i l l  happen  ? I  have  asked t h e  
self-same t h i n g  o f  b o t h men. b u t w h o do  y o u t h i n k  
w i l l  p r a y  the  harder  ? C e r t a i n l y  M r .  B . W h y ? Be-
cause he  is  no  speaker. I n  t h e  m a t t e r  o f  speaking he 
has  no  resources  o f  his  own  t o  depend u p o n . H e w i l l  
p r a y ,  L o r d ,  i f  y o u  do  n o t  give  me  p o w e r ,  I  cannot do 
t h i s . Of  course  M r .  A .  w i l l  p r a y  t o o ,  b u t  not  as  ear-
nestly  as  M r .  B . ,  f o r  i n  t h e  m a t t e r  o f  speaking  he  has  
something  i n  t h e  flesh  u p o n  w h i c h  t o  repy.  
D o  y o u  see n o w  w h a t  t h e  flesh  is  ?  A n y t h i n g  we  can  
do  o f ourselves  is  flesh.  A n y t h i n g  we  have i n  ourselves  
is  flesh.  A l l our  n a t u r a l  a b i l i t y , a l l  o u r  n a t u r a l  assets,  
a l l  we  are  i n  ourselves  : t h a t  is flesh. 
N o w , suppose instead  o f asking  M r . A .  and  M r . B .  t o 
speak,  I  ask  t h e m  t o  t a k e  charge  o f  the  p r a c t i c a l  side  
o f affairs  at  the  conference. W h a t  w i l l  happen  ? The 
position  w i l l  be  e x a c t l y  reversed. N o w  i t  w i l l  be  M r .  
A . ? 
s  t u r n  t o  p r a y  h a r d ,  f o r  he  k n o w s  f u l l  w e l l  t h a t  he  
has  no  organizing  a b i l i t y . M r .  B .  o f  course,  w i l l  p r a y  
t o o ,  but  n o t  so  h a r d  ;  f o r t h o u g h  he  knows  his  need  o f  
the  L o r d ,  he  is not  nearly  as  conscious  of  need  in  busi-
ness matters  as  M r . A . D o  y o u  see  here  the  difference  
between  what  is  o f  the  flesh  and w h a t  o f  the  S p i r i t ? 
A l l  we  have  by  nature  is  o f  t h e flesh. We can  test  i t 
i n  t h i s way.  A n y t h i n g  we  can  do  w i t h o u t p r a y e r ,  w i t h -
o u t dependence  upon God, t h a t m u s t be the flesh. 
A l a s !  we  t h i n k  so  v e r y  h i g h l y  o f  the flesh. H o w we 
envy  our  neighbour  who  is  such  a  good  speaker. H o w 
we  wish  we  could  speak  l i k e  h i m . Others  possess gifts 
which  we t h i n k  would  be  an  even  greater  asset  t o  us  i n 
our  service for God,  and  we  deplore  o u r  lack  of  n a t u r a l 
talents. 
N a t u r a l Endowment Confers No Advantage for a 
L i f e  i n the Spirit 
B u t we  are  a l l  w r o n g  i n  our  reasoning, for  every  
Christian  must begin  at  zero. W e m u s t never t h i n k  
anyone  has  an  advantage  over  us  t h r o u g h  t h a t  which  
he  possessed  before  conversion. N o ,  a l l  t h a t  is  born  of  
the  flesh  is flesh. God w i l l  t r a n s f e r  n o t h i n g  f r o m  the  
old creation  to the new. T h e Cross is  the greatest

Our L o r d said, "  T h e flesh p r o f i t e t h nothing " 
( J o h n  v i .  6 3 ) ; and  since  H e  has  declared 4 i
  the  flesh  
p r o f i t e t h  n o t h i n g  " ,  t h e n  clearly i t does p r o f i t  nothing.  
S h o r t l y  a f t e r  m y  conversion  I went  o u t  preaching  i n  
t h e  villages.  I  had  h a d  a  good  e d u c a t i o n  and  was  well  
versed i n the Scriptures  : so I considered myself

despite  t h e i r  i l l i t e r a c y ,  these  w o m e n had  an i n t i m a t e  
knowledge  o f the  L o r d . I  knew  the  B o o k  :  thev  knew  
t h e  One  o f  w h o m  the  B o o k  spoke. I  had  much  i n  t he 
flesh, but  t h e y  had  m u c h  i n  t h e  S p i r i t .  
To-day  many  teachers  are  teaching others  on the 
s t r e n g t h  o f t h e i r carnal  e q u i p m e n t . T h e y  are  teachers  
a f t e r the flesh, n o t a f t e r  t h e S p i r i t . T h e y  have no 
s p i r i t u a l  knowledge  o f t h e  L o r d ,  but  o n l y  a  knowledge  
o f H i m  i n  the  flesh.  Our  L o r d said,  " T h e flesh profiteth 

n o t h i n g  "  : so  n o t h i n g t h a t is  o f  the flesh must be 
u t i l i z e d  i n  the  service o f  God. W c  arc  concerned w i t h

W e  set  o u t  t o acquire  patience,  and  love, and  gracious-

ness,  w i t h o u t asking whence the patience,  and love,

a b i l i t y  to  teach  others,  but  we  do  not  inquire  what  is  
the  source  o f  our  knowledge  and  our  a b i l i t y .  We  want  

patience,  and  i f  we  can  a c q u i r e  patience  we  are  satia-
