# The Normal Christian Life

There is a common Christian book called The Normal Christian Life written by
Watchman Nee. This book has had many publishes, each with variations that add,
remove, and change many paragraphs of content. How has this happened? It's
because it was not originally a book. The Normal Christian Life, as I
understand, was originally a series of talks given in 1939ish. It was then
published in 9 issues of a bi-monthly (every other month) magazine belonging to
Austin Sparks from November/December 1941 to sometime in 1943.

This repository is an attempt to make _another_ "publication" of The Normal
Christian Life, but this time by literally just copying and pasting from
www.austin-sparks.net and cleaning up the results as far as punctuation goes.
Given that this will be an html document I may also go back and change it so
that bible verses are hyperlinks to a site like https://biblegateway.com or
something.
