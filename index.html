  We shall take Romans 5:8 as our basis in studying the normal Christian life,
  and we shall approach our subject from an experimental point of view.

<h2>Sins and Sin</h2>
<p>
  The first eight chapters of Romans are a unit. Chapter 1 to chapter 5:11 forms
  the first half of this unit, and chapter 5:12 to chapter 8:39 the second half.
  The first half is spoken to sinners, the second half to saints; there is quite
  a difference between the two. For example, in the first section the word
  "sins" is used repeatedly; in the second it is never used. Again, in the first
  section we have "sins" in the plural; in the second we have "sin" in the
  singular. Why is this? Because in the first section it is a question of the
  sins I have committed before God, which can be enumerated, whilst in the
  second it is a question of sin as a principle of life in me. No matter how
  many sins I commit, it is always the one sin principle that leads to them. The
  former touches my conscience, the latter my life. The former needs
  forgiveness, the latter needs deliverance. I may get forgiveness for all my
  sins, but because of my sin I have even then no abiding peace of mind. When
  God's light first shines into my heart my one cry is for forgiveness, for I
  realise I have committed sins before Him; but once I have forgiveness of
  <em>sins</em> I make a new discovery, namely, the discovery of sin, and I
  realise I have not only committed sins before God, but that there is something
  wrong within. There is an inward inclination to sin, a power within that draws
  me to sin. When that power breaks out I commit sins. I may seek and receive
  forgiveness, but then I sin again. So life goes on in a vicious circle,
  sinning and being forgiven, and then sinning again. I appreciate God's
  forgiveness, but I want something more than that, I want deliverance. We need
  forgiveness for what we have done, but we need deliverance from what we are.

<h2>The Blood and the Cross</h2>
<p>
  Thus in the first eight chapters of Romans, two aspects of salvation are
  presented to us. The first half of this section of the epistle deals with
  forgiveness of sins, the second with deliverance from sin. In the first part
  the Blood of the Lord Jesus is mentioned, but never the Cross. In the second
  part the Cross is mentioned, but never the Blood. Again, why is this? The
  Blood is for atonement and is before God. The Blood can wash away my sins, but
  it cannot wash away my old man. It needs the Cross to crucify <em>ME</em>. You
  cannot find the word " sinner " in the first four chapters of Romans. Often
  when a believer wants to convict a man in the street that, he is a sinner, he
  will use the favorite verse, Romans 3:23, but that use of the verse is not
  really justified by the Scriptures. The word "sinner" comes first in chapter
  5. In that chapter a sinner is said to be a sinner because he is born a
  sinner; not because he has committed sins. How were we constituted sinners? By
  Adam's disobedience. We do not become sinners by what we have done, but
  because of what Adam has done. I speak English, but I am not thereby
  constituted an Englishman. Chapter three deals with what we have done; but it
  is not what we have done that makes us sinners. I once asked a class of
  children, "Who is a sinner?" and they replied, "One who sins". Yes, one who
  sins is a sinner; but it is equally true that one who does not sin is a sinner
  too. You understand what 1 mean. There are bad sinners and good sinners. A
  Dane may be born in America and unable to speak Danish; but he is a Dane for
  all that, because he was born a Dane. I am a sinner because I am born of Adam.
  I am not a sinner because I sin, but I sin because I am a sinner. We are apt
  to think that what we have done is very bad, but that we ourselves are not so
  bad. God takes pains to show us that we ourselves are wrong, fundamentally
  wrong.
