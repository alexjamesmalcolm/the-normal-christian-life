  We shall take Romans 5:8 as our basis in studying the normal Christian life,
  and we shall approach our subject from an experimental point of view.

<h2>Sins and Sin</h2>
<p>
  The first eight chapters of Romans are a unit. Chapter 1 to chapter 5:11 forms
  the first half of this unit, and chapter 5:12 to chapter 8:39 the second half.
  The first half is spoken to sinners, the second half to saints; there is quite
  a difference between the two. For example, in the first section the word
  "sins" is used repeatedly; in the second it is never used. Again, in the first
  section we have "sins" in the plural; in the second we have "sin" in the
  singular. Why is this? Because in the first section it is a question of the
  sins I have committed before God, which can be enumerated, whilst in the
  second it is a question of sin as a principle of life in me. No matter how
  many sins I commit, it is always the one sin principle that leads to them. The
  former touches my conscience, the latter my life. The former needs
  forgiveness, the latter needs deliverance. I may get forgiveness for all my
  sins, but because of my sin I have even then no abiding peace of mind. When
  God's light first shines into my heart my one cry is for forgiveness, for I
  realise I have committed sins before Him; but once I have forgiveness of
  <em>sins</em> I make a new discovery, namely, the discovery of sin, and I
  realise I have not only committed sins before God, but that there is something
  wrong within. There is an inward inclination to sin, a power within that draws
  me to sin. When that power breaks out I commit sins. I may seek and receive
  forgiveness, but then I sin again. So life goes on in a vicious circle,
  sinning and being forgiven, and then sinning again. I appreciate God's
  forgiveness, but I want something more than that, I want deliverance. We need
  forgiveness for what we have done, but we need deliverance from what we are.
