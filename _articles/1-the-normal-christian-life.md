We shall take
[Romans 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.5.8){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}
as our basis in studying the normal Christian life, and we shall approach our
subject from an experimental point of view.

## Sins and Sin

The first eight chapters of Romans are a unit.
[Chapter 1 to chapter 5:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.1-Rom.5.11){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}
forms the first half of this unit, and
[chapter 5:12 to chapter 8:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.5.12-Rom.8.39){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}
the second half. The first half is spoken to sinners, the second half to saints;
there is quite a difference between the two. For example, in the first section
the word "sins" is used repeatedly; in the second it is never used. Again, in
the first section we have "sins" in the plural; in the second we have "sin" in
the singular. Why is this? Because in the first section it is a question of the
sins I have committed before God, which can be enumerated, whilst in the second
it is a question of sin as a principle of life in me. No matter how many sins I
commit, it is always the one sin principle that leads to them. The former
touches my conscience, the latter my life. The former needs forgiveness, the
latter needs deliverance. I may get forgiveness for all my sins, but because of
my sin I have even then no abiding peace of mind. When God's light first shines
into my heart my one cry is for forgiveness, for I realise I have committed sins
before Him; but once I have forgiveness of _sins_ I make a new discovery,
namely, the discovery of sin, and I realise I have not only committed sins
before God, but that there is something wrong within. There is an inward
inclination to sin, a power within that draws me to sin. When that power breaks
out I commit sins. I may seek and receive forgiveness, but then I sin again. So
life goes on in a vicious circle, sinning and being forgiven, and then sinning
again. I appreciate God's forgiveness, but I want something more than that, I
want deliverance. We need forgiveness for what we have done, but we need
deliverance from what we are.

## The Blood and the Cross

Thus in the first eight chapters of Romans, two aspects of salvation are
presented to us. The first half of this section of the epistle deals with
forgiveness of sins, the second with deliverance from sin. In the first part the
Blood of the Lord Jesus is mentioned, but never the Cross. In the second part
the Cross is mentioned, but never the Blood. Again, why is this? The Blood is
for atonement and is before God. The Blood can wash away my sins, but it cannot
wash away my old man. It needs the Cross to crucify _me_. You cannot find the
word "sinner" in the first four chapters of Romans. Often when a believer wants
to convict a man in the street that, he is a sinner, he will use the favorite
verse,
[Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.3.23){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"},
but that use of the verse is not really justified by the Scriptures. The word
"sinner" comes first in chapter 5. In that chapter a sinner is said to be a
sinner because he is born a sinner; not because he has committed sins. How were
we constituted sinners? By Adam's disobedience. We do not become sinners by what
we have done, but because of what Adam has done. I speak English, but I am not
thereby constituted an Englishman. Chapter three deals with what we have done;
but it is not what we have done that makes us sinners. I once asked a class of
children, "Who is a sinner?" and they replied, "One who sins". Yes, one who sins
is a sinner; but it is equally true that one who does not sin is a sinner too.
You understand what 1 mean. There are bad sinners and good sinners. A Dane may
be born in America and unable to speak Danish; but he is a Dane for all that,
because he was born a Dane. I am a sinner because I am born of Adam. I am not a
sinner because I sin, but I sin because I am a sinner. We are apt to think that
what we have done is very bad, but that we ourselves are not so bad. God takes
pains to show us that we ourselves are wrong, fundamentally wrong.

## Some Further Features

In the first section of Romans, therefore, we have the Blood to deal with what
we have done, whilst in the second section we have the Cross to deal with what
we are. We not only need the Blood for forgiveness, we need the Cross for
deliverance. Further, two different aspects of the resurrection are mentioned in
these two sections, in chapters four and six. In chapter four the resurrection
is mentioned as a proof of our justification. In chapter six it is spoken of as
an impartation of life. Peace, too, is spoken of in both sections, in the fifth
and eighth chapters respectively. What kind of peace is spoken of in the first
section? Peace with God. Now that 1 have forgiveness of sins God will not be a
cause of dread and trouble to me any more; but I am going to be a great cause of
trouble to myself. There is still unrest within, for within there is something
that draws me to sin. There is peace with God, but there is no peace with
myself. There is civil war in my own heart. Now the first half of this section
of Romans deals with the question of justification, and the second half with the
question of sanctification. If we only know the former then we are living a
subnormal Christian life. How can we live a normal Christian life? How we do
enter in? We must have forgiveness of sins, we must have peace with God, we must
have justification; that is our basis.

## Man's State by Nature

Now let us look at
[Romans 5:12-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.5.12-21){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
What is the meaning of this passage? Here the Spirit of God is seeking to show
us what we are. At the beginning of our Christian life we are only concerned
with our doing, not with our being; we are distressed by what we have done. We
think if only we could rectify certain things we should be good Christians, and
so we set about to change our actions. Then we discover to our dismay that it is
something more than just a case of trouble on the outside, that there is more
serious trouble on the inside. We try to please the Lord, but find something
within that does not want to please Him. We try to be humble, but there is
something in our very being that refuses to be humble. We try to be loving, but
inside we feel most unloving. We smile and try to look very gracious, but inside
we feel decidedly ungracious. The more we try to rectify matters on the outside,
the more we realise how deep-seated the trouble is on the inside. Then we come
to the Lord and say, "Lord, not only what I have done is wrong, I am wrong"

Thus in Romans, Paul first seeks to show us what we have done, then he seeks to
show us what we are. We are all constituted sinners
([Romans 5:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.5.19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}).
How did this come about? By the disobedience of one man. My name is Nee. I did
not choose it. I did not go through all the list of possible names and select
this one. That my name is Nee is not of my doing, and nothing I do can alter it.
I am a Nee because my father is a Nee, and my father is a Nee because my
grandfather is a Nee. If I act like a Nee I am a Nee; if I act unlike a Nee I am
still a Nee. If I become President of the Chinese republic I am a Nee; if I
become a beggar in the street I am still a Nee. Nothing I do or refrain from
doing will make me other than a Nee. We are not sinners because of ourselves,
but because of Adam. Because by birth I come of Adam, therefore I am a part of
him. It is not because I individually have sinned that I am a sinner, but
because I was in Adam when he sinned.

In China I was once talking in this strain and remarked, "We have all sinned in
Adam". A man said, "I don't understand". So I sought to explain it in this way:

> "All Chinese trace their descent from Huang-ti. Over four thousand years ago
> he had a war with Si-iu. His enemy was very strong, but nevertheless Huang-ti
> over came him and slew him. Then Huang-ti founded the Chinese nation. Four
> thousand years ago Huang-ti killed his enemy, and now today we have the
> Chinese nation. Now, what would have happened if Huang-ti had not killed his
> enemy, but his enemy had killed him instead? Where would you be now?"

"There would be no me at all", he said. "Oh, no, Huang-ti can die his death, and
you can live your life". "Impossible! If he had died, then I would never have
lived, for I have derived my life from him." Do you see the oneness of human
life? Our life comes from Adam. We derived our existence from him, and because
his life was a sinful life, therefore our life is sinful. So the trouble is our
heredity, not our behavior. Unless we can change our parentage there is no
deliverance for us: and that is exactly bow God dealt with the situation. In
Romans 5 we are not only told something about Adam, we are also told something
about the Lord Jesus. We were made sinners because of Adam; but we were made
righteous because of Christ. Because of one we were constituted sinners; because
of Another we were constituted righteous. When the Lord Jesus died. He did away
with all life in Adam; when He rose He imparted new life to us.

## The Divine Way of Deliverance

Now here is our problem. We were born sinners; how, then, can we cut off our
sinful heredity? Seeing that we were born into Adam, how can we get out of Adam?
Since we came in by birth, we must go out by death. To do away with our
sinfulness we must do away with our life. Bondage to sin came by birth;
deliverance from sin comes by death. Death is the secret of emancipation. But
how can we die? Some of us have tried very hard to get rid of this life, but we
have found it most tenacious. What is the way out? Not by trying to kill
ourselves, but by recognizing that God has dealt with us in Christ. Then how can
we get into Christ? We have no way of getting in; but we need not try to get in,
for we are in. What we could not do for ourselves, God has done for us; He has
put us in Christ. Praise God, it is not left for us either to devise a way, or
to work it out. "Of Him are ye in Christ Jesus." We need not plan how to get in.
God has planned it; and He has not only planned, He has also performed. "Of Him
are ye in Christ Jesus." We are in, therefore we need not try to get in. It is a
Divine act, and it is accomplished.

To illustrate, I put a bank-note in my bible. Of _me_ is the note in this bible.
Now I post the bible to Shanghai. Can the bible go to China and the note remain
in Denmark? Where the bible goes the note goes. Whatever the bible goes through
the note goes through too, for it is in the bible. "Of Him are ye in Christ
Jesus." God has put us in Christ, and in His dealing with Christ. God has dealt
with the whole race. Our destiny is bound up with His. What He has gone through
we have gone through. He was crucified: then what about us? Must we ask God to
crucify us? Never! When Christ was crucified we were crucified; and His
crucifixion is past, therefore ours cannot be future. I challenge you to find
one text in the New Testament showing that crucifixion is in the future. All the
references to our crucifixion are in the aorist tense, which is the
"once-for-all" tense, the "eternal past" tense.
([See Romans 6:6, Gal. 2:20, 5:24, 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.6.6,Gal.2.20,Gal.5.24,Gal.6.14){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}).
No man could ever commit suicide by crucifixion, for no man could crucify
himself. We were crucified when He was crucified, for God put us in Him. That we
have died in Christ is not a mere doctrinal position, it is an eternal fact.

## The Death and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus alike Inclusive

[Romans 6:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.6.1-Rom.6.11){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
The death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is
also inclusive. In
[1 Cor 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Cor.15){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"},
the Lord is spoken of as the last Adam and the second Man. The Scripture does
not refer to him as the second Adam, but as the last Adam; nor does it refer to
Him as the last Man, but as the second Man. As the last Adam He is the sum total
of humanity; as the second Man He is the Head of a new race. As the last Adam He
gathers up into Himself all that was in Adam; as the second Man, having by His
Cross done away with the first man in whom God's purpose was frustrated, He
brings in another Man in whom that purpose is fully realized. When He was
crucified on the Cross He was crucified as the last Adam. All that was in the
first Adam was done away with in the last Adam. We were all included in His
death. As the last Adam He wipes out the old race; as the second Man He brings
in a new race. It is in His resurrection that He stands as the second Man. We
died in Him as the last Adam; we live in Him as the second Man.
