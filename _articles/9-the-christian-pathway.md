READING: Romans 8:4-9; John 3:6; Philippians 3:3-4

During these days we have touched on four main points, and all four are related
to the Cross. No one can really live the Christian life till these four points
have been touched by the Cross. Let us mention them again.

1. Our sins. No one can be a Christian whose sins have not been dealt with.
   Praise the Lord! our sins have been dealt with by His death. His blood has
   cleansed us from every sin.

2. Ourselves. Not only has the Lord dealt with our sins, but also with our old
   man. It is possible to be a Christian without seeing that fact, but it is
   only possible to be a very miserable Christian. The Blood had dealt with our
   sins; the Cross has dealt with ourselves.

3. Our wills. The will has also been dealt with by the Cross, and once we
   definitely accept that, in an act of unqualified surrender to the Lord, our
   position is that of those who no longer have any will of their own but are
   willing for Him to work out His will in them. No man can live a true
   Christian life who seeks to retain his own will.

4. Our natural life. The Lord by His Cross has also dealt with our carnal powers
   to serve Him. Those powers are dealt with by the Cross till we reach a point
   where we dare not trust ourselves at all, but acknowledge we can do nothing
   whatever to please God.

These four points are fundamental, and we cannot live the normal Christian life
without seeing them, and seeing them experimentally.
