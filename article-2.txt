The Fruit  of Revelation 
Some of  you,  prior to your salvation, may have 
t r i e d  to  save  yourselves. You  read  the Bible, 
prayed,  went  to  church,  gave  alms. Then  one  
day  your  eyes were  opened  and  you  saw  t h a t  a  
full  salvation had  already  been provided for you 
on  the  Cross. You just accepted t h a t  and  thank-
ed  the  L o r d ,  and  peace and  j o y  flowed  into your 
heart. Now,  salvation and sanctification are 
on  exactly  the  same basis. You receive  deliver-
ance i n the  same way as  you receive forgiveness 
of  sins. For  years maybe  you have t r i e d  to exer-
cise control over  yourself,  and  improve  yourself,  
but  all to  no  purpose. When  you  see  the  t r u t h  
you w i l l  cease to  do  anything. Revelation stops 
all human effort. I n  w r i t i n g  to  the Romans, 
Paul  said,  "  Knowing this, t h a t  our old man  was  
crucified  w i t h  H i m "  (Rom.  v i .  6).  Do you  know  
this  ? The  whole  question  of deliverance begins 
w i t h knowing. Without  knowing  you cannot 
have  deliverance. The first four chapters  of  
Romans  speak of  faith, and faith and faith. 
W i t h o u t faith no  one can  have  forgiveness of  
sins and  justification. I n the  next  four  chapters  
you find no  mention  of this  k i n d  of  faith. The 
condition  of  l i v i n g  the  normal  Christian  life  is  
(1) Knowing, (2)  Yielding, (3)  Walking  i n  the  
Spirit. L i v i n g  a normal Christian life  must  begin  
w i t h a very definite "  knowing "  ; not just 
knowing  something about the t r u t h , not just  
understanding  some  doctrine,  not  a  mere  intel-
lectual  knowledge,  but  an  opening  of the  eyes of 
the  heart  to  see  what  we  have  i n  Christ.  When 
you have seen, then you know beyond all 
possibility  of doubt. 
How do  you  know  your  sins  are forgiven ? 
Because your  Pastor  told  you  so  ?  No, you just 
know i t  !  I f I ask,  How do you know, you simply 
answer,  I  know  i t  ! Such  knowledge  comes  by  
revelation. You know i t i n your  own heart, you 
see  i t i n your  own spirit. A light  has  shined  into 
your  inner  being,  and  you  are  persuaded  of  the  
fact. I t is not  because anyone  has  t o l d  you,  and 
not  even  because  Romans  v i . tells  you. That 
would  not  be  good  enough. You  know  it because 
God  has  revealed it  in  your  heart. You  may  not  
feel  i t ,  and  you may not understand  i t ;  but you 
know  i t , for  you  have  seen  i t . Once  you  have  
really  seen  yourself i n  Christ,  then  nothing  can  
shake your assurance of the  fact.  
Now, i f  you ask  a  number of  believers who 
have  entered  into the  normal  Christian life how 
they came  by  their  experience, some  will say 
this  way  and  some  w i l l  say  that. Each  stresses  
his  own  particular  way  of  entering  i n  and  pro-
duces  scripture  to  support  his  experience  ; and  
unfortunately many  Christians  are using  their  
special  experiences  and  their  special scriptures 
to fight  other  Christians. The fact  of the  matter  
is, t h a t whilst Christians may enter  into the 
deeper life  by different ways,  we need not  regard  
the experiences or doctrines they stress as 
mutually  exclusive,  but  rather as complement-
ary  one  to the  other.  
The  second  half  of the  first  section  of Romans 
speaks of three different steps by which  we enter 
into  the  fuller life. I f we  would  live  a  normal  
Christian  life,  then  we must  take  all three steps ; 
not  one,  or  two,  but  all three. The  first  step  is  
revelation  ; revelation,  t h a t is  to say, not  of  
myself,  but  of the  work  of the  L o r d  Jesus on  the  
Cross. When  Hudson  Taylor  entered into  the  
normal  Christian  life  i t  was  thus  he  entered  i n .  
He  had first tried  to  get  into  Christ,  but had 
found  himself always  slipping out,  so  to  speak.  
When  the  L o r d  showed  h i m  he  was  already  i n  
Christ  as  the  branch  i n  the  vine,  he  no  longer  
t r i e d to  get i n , but  could praise the  L o r d he was  i n .  
Think  of the  bewilderment  of t r y i n g  to  get  into  
a  room  i n  which  you  already  are. Think  of  the  
absurdity  of asking  to  be  put  i n . I f I  recognise  
the  fact  t h a t  I  am  i n , I  make  no  effort  to  enter.  
I f  we had  more  revelation we should have  fewer  
prayers. Much  of our  praying is just because we 
are  blind. Once  I  was  sitting  w i t h  a  co-worker  
seeking  to  lead  a  man  into  the  fuller life. Said 
the  man,  "  The  best  a  man  can  do  is  to  p r a y " .  
B u t i f  God  has already  given  you  everything,  
what  do  you need to  pray  for  ? we asked. "  He  
hasn't  ",  the  man  replied,  " for  I  am  s t i l l losing 
m y temper, s t i l l  failing  constantly  : so  I must 
pray  more  " . I  said,  Well,  do  you get  what  you 
pray  for  ? " I  am  sorry  to  say  I  do  not  get  any-
thing  ",  he  said. I  t r i e d  to  point  out  that just  
as  he  had  done  nothing  for  his  justification, so 
he  need  do  nothing for  his  sanctification. Then 
m y co-worker  said,  What  is  this  on  the  table  ?  
"  A  flask."  Can  you  imagine  this  flask  praying, 
L o r d ,  w i l l  You have  mercy  on  me  and  make  me  
into  a  flask.  "  I t  would  be nonsense to  pray  like  
t h a t  ",  the  man  said  ; "  i t  is  a  flask  ". Well, 
said m y co-worker, you are  dead  ! You  are  
crucified  ! W h y  pray  to  become  dead  ? W h y 
pray  to  be  crucified ?  I t  is just  as  absurd. Y o u 
do  not  need to  pray  to  the  L o r d  to  do anything, 
you merely need your eyes opened  to see  that  H e 
15 Austins-Sparks.Net - AWAT Volume 19 - Searchable
has  done  all. That  is  the  point. We  need  not  
work to die, we need  not wait to die, we are dead. 
We only  need  to  recognise  what  the L o r d has 
already  done,  and  praise  H i m for i t . 
The Cross  Deals  with  the  Boot  Cause  
Now, suppose the  Government  should wish  to 
deal drastically w i t h the question of strong  
d r i n k ,  and  decide  that  the  whole  country  shall 
go  dry,  how  could  the  decision  be  carried  into  
effect  ? How  could we  help  ? I f  we  were to  
search every shop and house  throughout the 
land  and  smash  all the  bottles  of wine,  or  beer,  
or brandy  we came across,  would  t h a t  meet  the  
case  ? We  might  r i d the  land  of every  drop of 
alcoholic  liquor i t  contains, but behind  these  
bottles  of  strong drink are the factories that 
produce them,  and i f  we  only deal w i t h the 
bottles and  leave  the  factories  untouched,  there  
is  no  permanent solution  to  the  problem.  The  
drink-producing  factories  must  be  destroyed i f 
the  drink  question  is to  be  permanently  settled.  
We are  the  factory,  our  actions  are  the  pro-
ducts. The  Blood  of the  L o r d  Jesus  dealt w i t h  
the  question  o f the  products,  namely,  w i t h  our  
sins. The  question  of  what  we  have done  is  
settled  ; but  what  about  the  question  of  what  
we  are  % Our sins were produced by us. Our sins  
have  been  dealt  w i t h ,  but  how  are  we  going to 
be  dealt  w i t h  ?  Do you  believe the  L o r d  would  
cleanse  away  all our  sins,  and  then  leave  us  to  
p u t away  the  sin-producing factory  ? Do  you 
believe  He w i l l  put  away  the  goods  produced,  
but leave  us  to  deal  w i t h  the  source  of produc-
t i o n  ?  No, He has  done away  w i t h  the goods  and 
also  done  away  w i t h  the  factory  that produces 
the  goods.  
On "Knowing"  and  "Reckoning" 
Note  again  Romans  v i . 6. The  tense  is  most  
precious, for i t is the  "  once-for-all " tense. The 
t h i n g  is done  and  i t  cannot  be  undone. Our old 
man has  been  crucified  once  for  a l l , and  he  can  
never  be  uncrucified. This  is  what  we  need  to  
know. When  we  know  this,  what  w i l l  follow ? 
Verse 11,  i n  which we  have the  exhortation,  
"  Reckon  ye  also  yourselves  to be  dead unto 
sin ",  is the  natural sequence to  verse  6. When 
we "know that  our  old man  has  been  crucified  we  
shall  spontaneously  reckon ourselves  to  be  dead.  
When  we  know,  then  reckoning  follows  natur-
ally.  B u t we must not lay too much emphasis  on  
the  matter  of reckoning. People  are  always  t r y -
ing to  reckon  without  knowing. They  have  not  
had  revelation  first,  yet  they  t r y to  reckon,  and 
soon  they  get  into  all sorts  of difficulties. When 
temptation  comes  they  begin to reckon  furiously  
â€” " I ' m dead,  I ' m dead,  I ' m dead  "  ;  but i n  the 
very  act of  reckoning  they  lose  their temper. 
Then they say,  I t won't work  ;  Romans  v i . 11  is  
no  good. Of  course  Romans  v i . 11 is  no  good  
without  Romans  v i .  6.  
W h a t does reckoning mean  ?  Reckoning is the 
only  accurate  t h i n g  a  person  can  do. A n  artist 
paints  a  landscape. Can  he  do  i t  w i t h perfect 
accuracy  ?  I n history, who would  vouch for  the  
absolute  accuracy  of any record, or i n geography 
for  the  perfect  correctness  of any map  ?  Even i n 
our everyday  speech,  when  we  t r y  to  t e l l  some  
incident,  w i t h  the  best  intentions  to  be  honest  
and t r u t h f u l we cannot speak w i t h perfect 
accuracy. W h a t  then can  a man  do  t h a t is 
utterly reliable  ?  Arithmetic  !  There is no scope 
for error  there. One  chair  plus  one  chair  equals  
two chairs. That  is  true  i n  Helsingor  and  i t  is  
just  as  true  i n Copenhagen. I f you travel south 
to  Berlin or north to  Oslo i t is s t i l l the same. A l l 
the world over  and  for  all  time  one  plus one 
equals  two. One  plus  one  equals  two i n  heaven  
and  earth  and  hell. W h y does God say  we are  to  
reckon  ourselves  dead  ? Because  we  are  dead.  
I f  I  have  K r .  15.00 i n m y pocket, what do I  enter  
i n  m y  account-book  ? Can  I  enter  K r .  14.00  or 
K r . 16.00  ? No,  I  must  enter  i n  m y  account-
book t h a t  which  is a  fact  i n m y pocket.  I t is  be-
cause  I am  really  dead that God  tells  me t o  
count  i t so. God  could  not  ask  me  to  put  down 
i n  m y account-book  that  I  am  dead  i f I  am  s t i l l  
alive. Reckoning  does  not  mean  t h a t I have 
only  K r . 14.00 i n m y pocket,  but  hope  by  enter-
ing K r .  15.00  i n  m y  account-book that such 
reckoning  w i l l  make  up the  deficiency.  I f I  have  
not got  K r .  15.00,  yet  t r y  to  reckonâ€”" I have 
K r . 15.00 ;  I  have  K r . 15.00 ;  I  have  K r . 15.00 ; 
w i l l  such  reckoning  affect  the  fact  that  I have 
only K r .  14.  i n  m y  pocket  ? Reckoning w i l l 
not make  nothing into  K r .  15, nor  w i l l  i t  make  
K r . 14 into  K r .  15. B u t  i f i t  is  a  fact  that  you  
have K r .  15  i n  your  pocket,  then w i t h great 
ease and assurance you  can  enter  K r . 15 i n your 
account-book. 
After you  reckon  yourself dead w i t h  Christ,  
the Devil w i l l  come  and  say, "  There  is  some-
thing  moving  inside  ;  what  about  i t  ?  Can you 
call  that death  ? " W h a t w i l l you  say then ? 
Now, you must choose  ! W i l l you believe

â€¢Satan's  lie  or  God's  t r u t h  ? (We  are  not  here  
denying the reality of the  "  flesh  ", but  speaking  
of being  moved  from a  revealed position  and  
fact,  namely, our  death  w i t h  Christ.)  I  may  not 
feel  t h a t  I  am  M r . Nee,  I  may  even  forget  that  
I am  M r . Nee,  I  may  even  dream  that  I  am  not  
Mr.  Nee  ;  but  when I  am sleeping I  am  M r .  Nee,  
and  when  I  am  awake  I  am  Mr. Nee  ; when  I  
remember  i t I  am  Mr.  Nee,  and  when I  forget i t 
I am  s t i l l  Mr. Nee. I t  is a  fact  which  nothing  I  
experience  or  fail  to  experience,  can  alter. So 
also,  whether  I  feel  i t  or  not,  I  am  dead  w i t h  
Christ. Whether  m y experience  proves  i t or dis-
proves  i t ,  the  fact  remains  unchanged. I f you 
stand  on  t h a t  fact,  then  Satan cannot prevail  
against  you. I f you  have  any  doubt  about  the  
fact,  Satan w i l l  surely get  you ;  but  i f you  have  
no  doubt,  then  i t  does  not  matter  what Satan 
does,  you  can well  afford to  laugh  at  h i m . I f  
anyone  should t r y to persuade me t h a t  I  am  not 
M r .  Nee,  I  could  well  afford  to do the  same.  Let.  
us,  then,  hold  fast  to  the  fact  that  when  Christ 
died,  we died  also.
