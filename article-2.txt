On "Knowing"  and  "Reckoning" 
Note  again  Romans  v i . 6. The  tense  is  most  
precious, for i t is the  "  once-for-all " tense. The 
t h i n g  is done  and  i t  cannot  be  undone. Our old 
man has  been  crucified  once  for  a l l , and  he  can  
never  be  uncrucified. This  is  what  we  need  to  
know. When  we  know  this,  what  w i l l  follow ? 
Verse 11,  i n  which we  have the  exhortation,  
"  Reckon  ye  also  yourselves  to be  dead unto 
sin ",  is the  natural sequence to  verse  6. When 
we "know that  our  old man  has  been  crucified  we  
shall  spontaneously  reckon ourselves  to  be  dead.  
When  we  know,  then  reckoning  follows  natur-
ally.  B u t we must not lay too much emphasis  on  
the  matter  of reckoning. People  are  always  t r y -
ing to  reckon  without  knowing. They  have  not  
had  revelation  first,  yet  they  t r y to  reckon,  and 
soon  they  get  into  all sorts  of difficulties. When 
temptation  comes  they  begin to reckon  furiously  
— " I ' m dead,  I ' m dead,  I ' m dead  "  ;  but i n  the 
very  act of  reckoning  they  lose  their temper. 
Then they say,  I t won't work  ;  Romans  v i . 11  is  
no  good. Of  course  Romans  v i . 11 is  no  good  
without  Romans  v i .  6.  
W h a t does reckoning mean  ?  Reckoning is the 
only  accurate  t h i n g  a  person  can  do. A n  artist 
paints  a  landscape. Can  he  do  i t  w i t h perfect 
accuracy  ?  I n history, who would  vouch for  the  
absolute  accuracy  of any record, or i n geography 
for  the  perfect  correctness  of any map  ?  Even i n 
our everyday  speech,  when  we  t r y  to  t e l l  some  
incident,  w i t h  the  best  intentions  to  be  honest  
and t r u t h f u l we cannot speak w i t h perfect 
accuracy. W h a t  then can  a man  do  t h a t is 
utterly reliable  ?  Arithmetic  !  There is no scope 
for error  there. One  chair  plus  one  chair  equals  
two chairs. That  is  true  i n  Helsingor  and  i t  is  
just  as  true  i n Copenhagen. I f you travel south 
to  Berlin or north to  Oslo i t is s t i l l the same. A l l 
the world over  and  for  all  time  one  plus one 
equals  two. One  plus  one  equals  two i n  heaven  
and  earth  and  hell. W h y does God say  we are  to  
reckon  ourselves  dead  ? Because  we  are  dead.  
I f  I  have  K r .  15.00 i n m y pocket, what do I  enter  
i n  m y  account-book  ? Can  I  enter  K r .  14.00  or 
K r . 16.00  ? No,  I  must  enter  i n  m y  account-
book t h a t  which  is a  fact  i n m y pocket.  I t is  be-
cause  I am  really  dead that God  tells  me t o  
count  i t so. God  could  not  ask  me  to  put  down 
i n  m y account-book  that  I  am  dead  i f I  am  s t i l l  
alive. Reckoning  does  not  mean  t h a t I have 
only  K r . 14.00 i n m y pocket,  but  hope  by  enter-
ing K r .  15.00  i n  m y  account-book that such 
reckoning  w i l l  make  up the  deficiency.  I f I  have  
not got  K r .  15.00,  yet  t r y  to  reckon—" I have 
K r . 15.00 ;  I  have  K r . 15.00 ;  I  have  K r . 15.00 ; 
w i l l  such  reckoning  affect  the  fact  that  I have 
only K r .  14.  i n  m y  pocket  ? Reckoning w i l l 
not make  nothing into  K r .  15, nor  w i l l  i t  make  
K r . 14 into  K r .  15. B u t  i f i t  is  a  fact  that  you  
have K r .  15  i n  your  pocket,  then w i t h great 
ease and assurance you  can  enter  K r . 15 i n your 
account-book. 
After you  reckon  yourself dead w i t h  Christ,  
the Devil w i l l  come  and  say, "  There  is  some-
thing  moving  inside  ;  what  about  i t  ?  Can you 
call  that death  ? " W h a t w i l l you  say then ? 
Now, you must choose  ! W i l l you believe

•Satan's  lie  or  God's  t r u t h  ? (We  are  not  here  
denying the reality of the  "  flesh  ", but  speaking  
of being  moved  from a  revealed position  and  
fact,  namely, our  death  w i t h  Christ.)  I  may  not 
feel  t h a t  I  am  M r . Nee,  I  may  even  forget  that  
I am  M r . Nee,  I  may  even  dream  that  I  am  not  
Mr.  Nee  ;  but  when I  am sleeping I  am  M r .  Nee,  
and  when  I  am  awake  I  am  Mr. Nee  ; when  I  
remember  i t I  am  Mr.  Nee,  and  when I  forget i t 
I am  s t i l l  Mr. Nee. I t  is a  fact  which  nothing  I  
experience  or  fail  to  experience,  can  alter. So 
also,  whether  I  feel  i t  or  not,  I  am  dead  w i t h  
Christ. Whether  m y experience  proves  i t or dis-
proves  i t ,  the  fact  remains  unchanged. I f you 
stand  on  t h a t  fact,  then  Satan cannot prevail  
against  you. I f you  have  any  doubt  about  the  
fact,  Satan w i l l  surely get  you ;  but  i f you  have  
no  doubt,  then  i t  does  not  matter  what Satan 
does,  you  can well  afford to  laugh  at  h i m . I f  
anyone  should t r y to persuade me t h a t  I  am  not 
M r .  Nee,  I  could  well  afford  to do the  same.  Let.  
us,  then,  hold  fast  to  the  fact  that  when  Christ 
died,  we died  also.
