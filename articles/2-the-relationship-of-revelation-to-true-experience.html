      <p>READING: Romans 6:1-11</p>
      <p>
        The death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. The resurrection of the Lord
        Jesus is also inclusive. In 1 Cor 5:1 the Lord is spoken of as the last
        Adam and the second Man. The Scripture does not refer to him as the
        second Adam, but as the last Adam; nor does it refer to Him as the last
        Man, but as the second Man. As the last Adam He is the sum total of
        humanity; as the second Man He is the Head of a new race. As the last
        Adam He gathers up into Himself all that was in Adam; as the second Man,
        having by His Cross done away with the first man in whom God's purpose
        was frustrated, He brings in another Man in whom that purpose is fully
        realized. When He was crucified on the Cross He was crucified as the
        last Adam. All that was in the first Adam was done away within the last
        Adam. We were all included in His death. As the last Adam He puts away
        the old race; as the second Man He brings in a new race. It is in His
        resurrection that He stands as the second Man. We died in Him as the
        last Adam; we live in Him as the second Man. Our old history ends with
        the Cross; our new history begins with the resurrection.
        <q
          >Wherefore if any man is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old
          things are passed away; behold, they are become new</q
        >
        ( 2 Cor. 5:17, R.V.M.). The Cross terminates the first creation, and out
        of death there is brought in a new creation in Christ, the second Man.
        If we are
        <q>in Adam</q> all that is <q>in Adam</q> becomes ours by
        <q>free grace</q>! There is no need to make up our minds to lose our
        temper or commit any other sin; it all comes to us freely and despite
        ourselves. Likewise, if we are <q>i n Christ</q>, all that is in Christ
        comes to us by <q>free grace</q>, without any effort on our part.
