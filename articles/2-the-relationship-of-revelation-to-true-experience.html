        <p>READING: Romans 6:1-11</p>
        <p>
          The death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. The resurrection of the Lord
          Jesus is also inclusive. In 1 Cor 5:1 the Lord is spoken of as the
          last Adam and the second Man. The Scripture does not refer to him as
          the second Adam, but as the last Adam; nor does it refer to Him as the
          last Man, but as the second Man. As the last Adam He is the sum total
          of humanity; as the second Man He is the Head of a new race. As the
          last Adam He gathers up into Himself all that was in Adam; as the
          second Man, having by His Cross done away with the first man in whom
          God's purpose was frustrated, He brings in another Man in whom that
          purpose is fully realized. When He was crucified on the Cross He was
          crucified as the last Adam. All that was in the first Adam was done
          away within the last Adam. We were all included in His death. As the
          last Adam He puts away the old race; as the second Man He brings in a
          new race. It is in His resurrection that He stands as the second Man.
          We died in Him as the last Adam; we live in Him as the second Man. Our
          old history ends with the Cross; our new history begins with the
          resurrection.
          <q
            >Wherefore if any man is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old
            things are passed away; behold, they are become new</q
          >
          ( 2 Cor. 5:17, R.V.M.). The Cross terminates the first creation, and
          out of death there is brought in a new creation in Christ, the second
          Man. If we are
          <q>in Adam</q> all that is <q>in Adam</q> becomes ours by
          <q>free grace</q>! There is no need to make up our minds to lose our
          temper or commit any other sin; it all comes to us freely and despite
          ourselves. Likewise, if we are <q>i n Christ</q>, all that is in
          Christ comes to us by <q>free grace</q>, without any effort on our
          part.

        <h2>The Necessity for Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          Romans 6 shows that the death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. In His
          death we all died. None of us can progress spiritually without seeing
          this. If we have not seen Him bearing our sins on the Cross we cannot
          have justification; if we have not seen Him bearing us on the Cross we
          cannot have sanctification. Not only have our sins been put on Him ,
          but we ourselves have been put in Him . How did you get forgiveness?
          You realized the Lord Jesus died and bore your sins on Himself, that
          His Blood was shed to cleanse away your defilement. When you saw your
          sins all taken away on the Cross, what did you do? Did you pray? Did
          you say, <q>Lord Jesus, come and die for m y sins?</q> No, you did not
          pray at all, you only thanked the Lord. You did not beseech Him to
          come and die for you, you thanked Him because He had already died in
          your stead. Now, what is true of your forgiveness is also true of your
          deliverance. The work is done; therefore there is no need to pray, but
          only to praise. God has put us all in Christ, so that when Christ was
          crucified we were crucified too. It is done. Thus there is no need to
          pray, <q>I am a very wicked person, Lord please crucify me</q>. That
          is all wrong. You did not pray about your sins; why then pray about
          yourself? Your sins were dealt with by His Blood, and you were dealt
          with by His Cross. It is done. All that is left for you to do is to
          praise the Lord. When Christ died, you died; you died in Him. Do you
          believe in the death of the Lord? Of course you do. Well, the same
          Scripture that says He died for us, says that we died with Him.
          <q>Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him</q> (Romans
          6:6). I could turn it round and say, Christ has been crucified with
          our old man. Some of you came here in twos. You might say, My friend
          came with me ; but you might also say, I came with my friend. In
          history, (not in doctrine) we can say with equal truth, I was
          crucified with Christ, or, Christ was crucified with me. Has Christ
          been crucified? Then can I be uncrucified? I believe in the death of
          the Lord Jesus, and I believe in my own death just as surely as I
          believe in His. This is the Gospel. Why do you believe the Lord Jesus
          died? Because you feel He has died? No, you have never felt it. You
          believe He has died because God has declared it to be a fact. How do
          you know the thief of the cross was crucified? Because the Word of God
          tells you so. You believe in the death of the Lord, and you believe in
          the death of the thief; now, what about your own death? Have you died?
          How can you know? You can know, for the simple reason that God has
          said so. If you feel Christ has died, He has died, and if you do not
          feel He has died, He has died. If you feel you have died, you have
          died, and if you do not feel you have died, you have died. These are
          Divine facts. That Christ has died is a fact, that the thief has died
          is a fact, and that you have died is a fact also. Let me tell you, you
          have died. You are done with! You are ruled out! This is the Gospel
          for Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our crucifixion can never be made effective by will or by effort, but
          only by accepting what the Lord Jesus did on the Cross. Our eyes must
          be opened to see the finished work of Calvary. After my conversion I
          studied the Scriptures and knew that the Lord Jesus had died, and knew
          that I must die too; for I was too bad to live. So I tried to die, I
          tried to live as though I had died. With what result? The same old
          temper showed itself, the same old sins; there was no deliverance. For
          seven years after my conversion, despite all my efforts to die, I
          still could not enter into the experience of the death of Christ. One
          day I was upstairs sitting at my desk reading the Word and praying,
          when the Lord opened my eyes, and I saw that I died when the Lord
          died; and from that day the question of my death has been a matter of
          the past, not of the future. I can always look back and see my death
          as an accomplished fact. When I made this great discovery I jumped up
          from my chair, rushed downstairs, laid hold of my cook and said,
          <q>Do you know that I have died?</q> He looked puzzled; so I went on,
          <q
            >Do you know that Christ has died? Do you know that I am just as
            dead as Christ? Do you know that Christ is not a tiny bit more dead
            than I?</q
          >
          From that day to this I have never for one moment doubted my own
          death. Friends, this is the first step into a normal Christian life.
          If we are to live such a life our first need is of revelation. May God
          open our eyes to see what He has done for us in His Son
