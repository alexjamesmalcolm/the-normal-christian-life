        <p>READING: Romans 6:1-11</p>
        <p>
          The death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. The resurrection of the Lord
          Jesus is also inclusive. In 1 Cor 5:1 the Lord is spoken of as the
          last Adam and the second Man. The Scripture does not refer to him as
          the second Adam, but as the last Adam; nor does it refer to Him as the
          last Man, but as the second Man. As the last Adam He is the sum total
          of humanity; as the second Man He is the Head of a new race. As the
          last Adam He gathers up into Himself all that was in Adam; as the
          second Man, having by His Cross done away with the first man in whom
          God's purpose was frustrated, He brings in another Man in whom that
          purpose is fully realized. When He was crucified on the Cross He was
          crucified as the last Adam. All that was in the first Adam was done
          away within the last Adam. We were all included in His death. As the
          last Adam He puts away the old race; as the second Man He brings in a
          new race. It is in His resurrection that He stands as the second Man.
          We died in Him as the last Adam; we live in Him as the second Man. Our
          old history ends with the Cross; our new history begins with the
          resurrection.
          <q
            >Wherefore if any man is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old
            things are passed away; behold, they are become new</q
          >
          ( 2 Cor. 5:17, R.V.M.). The Cross terminates the first creation, and
          out of death there is brought in a new creation in Christ, the second
          Man. If we are
          <q>in Adam</q> all that is <q>in Adam</q> becomes ours by
          <q>free grace</q>! There is no need to make up our minds to lose our
          temper or commit any other sin; it all comes to us freely and despite
          ourselves. Likewise, if we are <q>i n Christ</q>, all that is in
          Christ comes to us by <q>free grace</q>, without any effort on our
          part.

        <h2>The Necessity for Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          Romans 6 shows that the death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. In His
          death we all died. None of us can progress spiritually without seeing
          this. If we have not seen Him bearing our sins on the Cross we cannot
          have justification; if we have not seen Him bearing us on the Cross we
          cannot have sanctification. Not only have our sins been put on Him ,
          but we ourselves have been put in Him . How did you get forgiveness?
          You realized the Lord Jesus died and bore your sins on Himself, that
          His Blood was shed to cleanse away your defilement. When you saw your
          sins all taken away on the Cross, what did you do? Did you pray? Did
          you say, <q>Lord Jesus, come and die for m y sins?</q> No, you did not
          pray at all, you only thanked the Lord. You did not beseech Him to
          come and die for you, you thanked Him because He had already died in
          your stead. Now, what is true of your forgiveness is also true of your
          deliverance. The work is done; therefore there is no need to pray, but
          only to praise. God has put us all in Christ, so that when Christ was
          crucified we were crucified too. It is done. Thus there is no need to
          pray, <q>I am a very wicked person, Lord please crucify me</q>. That
          is all wrong. You did not pray about your sins; why then pray about
          yourself? Your sins were dealt with by His Blood, and you were dealt
          with by His Cross. It is done. All that is left for you to do is to
          praise the Lord. When Christ died, you died; you died in Him. Do you
          believe in the death of the Lord? Of course you do. Well, the same
          Scripture that says He died for us, says that we died with Him.
          <q>Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him</q> (Romans
          6:6). I could turn it round and say, Christ has been crucified with
          our old man. Some of you came here in twos. You might say, My friend
          came with me ; but you might also say, I came with my friend. In
          history, (not in doctrine) we can say with equal truth, I was
          crucified with Christ, or, Christ was crucified with me. Has Christ
          been crucified? Then can I be uncrucified? I believe in the death of
          the Lord Jesus, and I believe in my own death just as surely as I
          believe in His. This is the Gospel. Why do you believe the Lord Jesus
          died? Because you feel He has died? No, you have never felt it. You
          believe He has died because God has declared it to be a fact. How do
          you know the thief of the cross was crucified? Because the Word of God
          tells you so. You believe in the death of the Lord, and you believe in
          the death of the thief; now, what about your own death? Have you died?
          How can you know? You can know, for the simple reason that God has
          said so. If you feel Christ has died, He has died, and if you do not
          feel He has died, He has died. If you feel you have died, you have
          died, and if you do not feel you have died, you have died. These are
          Divine facts. That Christ has died is a fact, that the thief has died
          is a fact, and that you have died is a fact also. Let me tell you, you
          have died. You are done with! You are ruled out! This is the Gospel
          for Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our crucifixion can never be made effective by will or by effort, but
          only by accepting what the Lord Jesus did on the Cross. Our eyes must
          be opened to see the finished work of Calvary. After my conversion I
          studied the Scriptures and knew that the Lord Jesus had died, and knew
          that I must die too; for I was too bad to live. So I tried to die, I
          tried to live as though I had died. With what result? The same old
          temper showed itself, the same old sins; there was no deliverance. For
          seven years after my conversion, despite all my efforts to die, I
          still could not enter into the experience of the death of Christ. One
          day I was upstairs sitting at my desk reading the Word and praying,
          when the Lord opened my eyes, and I saw that I died when the Lord
          died; and from that day the question of my death has been a matter of
          the past, not of the future. I can always look back and see my death
          as an accomplished fact. When I made this great discovery I jumped up
          from my chair, rushed downstairs, laid hold of my cook and said,
          <q>Do you know that I have died?</q> He looked puzzled; so I went on,
          <q
            >Do you know that Christ has died? Do you know that I am just as
            dead as Christ? Do you know that Christ is not a tiny bit more dead
            than I?</q
          >
          From that day to this I have never for one moment doubted my own
          death. Friends, this is the first step into a normal Christian life.
          If we are to live such a life our first need is of revelation. May God
          open our eyes to see what He has done for us in His Son

        <h2>The Fruit of Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          Some of you, prior to your salvation, may have tried to save
          yourselves. You read the Bible, prayed, went to church, gave alms.
          Then one day your eyes were opened and you saw that a full salvation
          had already been provided for you on the Cross. You just accepted that
          and thanked the Lord, and peace and joy flowed into your heart. Now,
          salvation and sanctification are on exactly the same basis. You
          receive deliverance in the same way as you receive forgiveness of
          sins. For years maybe you have tried to exercise control over
          yourself, and improve yourself, but all to no purpose. When you see
          the truth you will cease to do anything. Revelation stops all human
          effort. In writing to the Romans, Paul said,
          <q>Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him</q> (Romans
          6:6). Do you know this? The whole question of deliverance begins with
          knowing. Without knowing you cannot have deliverance. The first four
          chapters of Romans speak of faith, and faith and faith. Without faith
          no one can have forgiveness of sins and justification. In the next
          four chapters you find no mention of this kind of faith. The condition
          of living the normal Christian life is (1) Knowing, (2) Yielding, (3)
          Walking in the Spirit. Living a normal Christian life must begin with
          a very definite <q>knowing</q>; not just knowing something about the
          truth, not just understanding some doctrine, not a mere intellectual
          knowledge, but an opening of the eyes of the heart to see what we have
          in Christ. When you have seen, then you know beyond all possibility of
          doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do you know your sins are forgiven? Because your Pastor told you
          so? No, you just know it! If I ask, <q>How do you know,</q> you simply
          answer, <q>I know it!</q> Such knowledge comes by revelation. You know
          it in your own heart, you see it in your own spirit. A light has
          shined into your inner being, and you are persuaded of the fact. It is
          not because anyone has told you, and not even because Romans 6 tells
          you. That would not be good enough. You know it because God has
          revealed it in your heart. You may not feel it, and you may not
          understand it; but you know it, for you have seen it. Once you have
          really seen yourself in Christ, then nothing can shake your assurance
          of the fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if you ask a number of believers who have entered into the normal
          Christian life how they came by their experience, some will say this
          way and some will say that. Each stresses his own particular way of
          entering in and produces scripture to support his experience; and
          unfortunately many Christians are using their special experiences and
          their special scriptures to fight other Christians. The fact of the
          matter is, that whilst Christians may enter into the deeper life by
          different ways, we need not regard the experiences or doctrines they
          stress as mutually exclusive, but rather as complementary one to the
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second half of the first section of Romans speaks of three
          different steps by which we enter into the fuller life. If we would
          live a normal Christian life, then we must take all three steps; not
          one, or two, but all three. The first step is revelation; revelation,
          that is to say, not of myself, but of the work of the Lord Jesus on
          the Cross. When Hudson Taylor entered into the normal Christian life
          it was thus he entered in. He had first tried to get into Christ, but
          had found himself always slipping out, so to speak. When the Lord
          showed him he was already in Christ as the branch in the vine, he no
          longer tried to get in, but could praise the Lord he was in. Think of
          the bewilderment of trying to get into a room in which you already
          are. Think of the absurdity of asking to be put in. If I recognize the
          fact that I am in, I make no effort to enter. If we had more
          revelation we should have fewer prayers. Much of our praying is just
          because we are blind. Once I was sitting with a co-worker seeking to
          lead a man into the fuller life. Said the man,
          <q>The best a man can do is to pray</q>. But if God has already given
          you everything, what do you need to pray for? we asked.
          <q>He hasn't</q>, the man replied,
          <q
            >for I am still losing my temper, still failing constantly: so I
            must pray more</q
          >. I said, Well, do you get what you pray for?
          <q>I am sorry to say I do not get anything</q>, he said. I tried to
          point out that just as he had done nothing for his justification, so
          he need do nothing for his sanctification. Then my co-worker said,
          What is this on the table? <q>A flask.</q> Can you imagine this flask
          praying, Lord, will You have mercy on me and make me into a flask.
          <q>It would be nonsense to pray like that</q>, the man said;
          <q>it is a flask</q>. Well, said my co-worker, you are dead! You are
          crucified! Why pray to become dead? Why pray to be crucified? It is
          just as absurd. You do not need to pray to the Lord to do anything,
          you merely need your eyes opened to see that He has done all. That is
          the point. We need not work to die, we need not wait to die, we are
          dead. We only need to recognize what the Lord has already done, and
          praise Him for it.

        <h2>The Cross Deals with the Root Cause</h2>
        <p>
          Now, suppose the Government should wish to deal drastically with the
          question of strong drink, and decide that the whole country shall go
          dry, how could the decision be carried into effect? How could we help?
          If we were to search every shop and house throughout the land and
          smash all the bottles of wine, or beer, or brandy we came across,
          would that meet the case? We might rid the land of every drop of
          alcoholic liquor it contains, but behind these bottles of strong drink
          are the factories that produce them, and if we only deal with the
          bottles and leave the factories untouched, there is no permanent
          solution to the problem. The drink-producing factories must be
          destroyed if the drink question is to be permanently settled.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are the factory, our actions are the pro- ducts. The Blood of the
          Lord Jesus dealt with the question of the products, namely, with our
          sins. The question of what we have done is settled; but what about the
          question of what we are? Our sins were produced by us. Our sins have
          been dealt with, but how are we going to be dealt with? Do you believe
          the Lord would cleanse away all our sins, and then leave us to put
          away the sin-producing factory? Do you believe He will put away the
          goods produced, but leave us to deal with the source of production?
          No, He has done away with the goods and also done away with the
          factory that produces the goods.
