      During these days we have touched on four main points, and all four are
      related to the Cross. No one can really live the Christian life till
      these four points have been touched by the Cross. Let us mention them
      again.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Our sins. No one can be a Christian whose sins have not been dealt
        with. Praise the Lord! our sins have been dealt with by His death. His
        blood has cleansed us from every sin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ourselves. Not only has the Lord dealt with our sins, but also with
        our old man. It is possible to be a Christian without seeing that
        fact, but it is only possible to be a very miserable Christian. The
        Blood had dealt with our sins; the Cross has dealt with ourselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our wills. The will has also been dealt with by the Cross, and once we
        definitely accept that, in an act of unqualified surrender to the
        Lord, our position is that of those who no longer have any will of
        their own but are willing for Him to work out His will in them. No man
        can live a true Christian life who seeks to retain his own will.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our natural life. The Lord by His Cross has also dealt with our carnal
        powers to serve Him. Those powers are dealt with by the Cross till we
        reach a point where we dare not trust ourselves at all, but
        acknowledge we can do nothing whatever to please God.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These four points are fundamental, and we cannot live the normal
      Christian life without seeing them, and seeing them experimentally.
